Well, I guess I've survived? Someone described the end of term (0? or was it 1?) as anticlimactic, and I'd have to agree. There was a ... _big?_ ... snowstorm on Tuesday, and our CPSC 121 final ended up being canceled and rescheduled to next term. Apparently this is a common occurence here - Vancouver likes to lose its collective marbles over a bit of snow every winter, as some exams were canceled last winter T1 too.

As much as I make fun of Vancouverites for it, I'll concede that it's more hilly than say Edmonton or Toronto, so it would be an _adventure_ on hilly roads. Remember [this pileup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BhhsEuYXZQ) in Montreal? I could imagine that happening here too...

Anyways, here's some quick thoughts on the courses I took this term.

#### CPSC 110
This was a really ... interesting ... intro CS course. Very different from previous things I've taken like CS50x. Using a functional language like Racket can be frustrating if you've worked with an object oriented language before, and the course can be intimidating/confusing if you've not programmed before. But there's a lot of great things about this course! The templating/recipe stuff is really cool - teaching us to think about the abstract structure of what we're building before getting bogged down in the nuts and bolts implementation for a specific problem is quite handy. To be honest, one of my main motivations for coming back to study CS in university has to do with learning best practices and good design principles, so it's comforting to see that it starts early at UBC.

The data structures stuff was also really neat to see - how things are implemented in Racket/how it relates to stuff I've seen previously in CS50x and other classes/real world work. In terms of the difficulty curve though, it really seems to grow in exponential time as the term progresses - up to the first (and even second) midterm, everything progresses pretty nicely and stuff mostly makes sense. And then the last third of the course happens and everything goes out the window with search/accumulators/graphs!

#### MATH 200
Hey! Hahaha I didn't fail Calc 3. This was definitely a challenging course - my engineering friends told me math is really just about grinding out practice problems, and I'd have to agree with them. Hadn't really touched multivariable (or any?) calc since first year/second year of my previous degree, which was some time ago. Would definitely say it's useful to brush up on Calc 1/2 and trigonometry beforehand.

I think what surprised me the most was how MAT133 at UofT (shout out to Prof. Tate and my awesome TA!) covered a fair portion of multivariable calc - in terms of partial derivatives, methods to optimise functions of multiple variables, and doing simple double integrals. Obviously not to the same extent as what you'd take in Calc 3, but definitely more than what one would see in Calc 1/2 as an Arts/Science student. Maybe it's a handy tip to do the Commerce version of Calc 1/2 before Calc 3 then?

#### CPSC 121
Hmmm ... I thought the circuits and intro to how a computer works was cool! The discrete math/proofs stuff seemed pretty standard vs. what I've seen in other mathematical thinking/proofs/what-have-you courses. Maybe it seemed a little on the slow side pace-wise, but maybe not for a first year course. Overall it seems useful to be able to structure and understand arguments, as well as to argue about the "correctness" of algorithms or programs we write or use in future classes. Not really sure I've got much else to say aside from how our final was postponed 'til next term.
