**NB Dec 22, 2017:** I originally wrote this earlier in the year and posted it on Medium, when I had more time on my hands. Here's to hoping I'll get back to jotting notes down about thought provoking articles and longreads in the future.

Good morning! Hope you’ve had a good week and have some time to recuperate after Saint Patrick’s Day. I recently started keeping track of interesting articles, mostly longreads, that I’ve seen or been sent, in order to share them more widely. I’m hoping this becomes a weekly or monthly thing. So if you have some time to spare this morning (or whenever this weekend), feel free to settle in and read…

What better way to start than with some science fiction turned reality? I know it’s not quite _Jurassic Park_, and that some scientists might take offence at the comparisons, but it’s the most apt way to describe the work being done at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research and at Pleistocene Park in Siberia.

In “[Inside the Frozen Zoo That Could Bring Extinct Animals Back to Life](https://www.gq.com/story/inside-the-frozen-zoo-that-could-bring-extinct-animals-back-to-life)”, _GQ_’s Zach Baron takes a look at the quickening pace of extinction threatening species across the globe, and scientists’ efforts to preserve a catalogue of life and biodiversity before it disappears. While some might dispute the idea of resurrecting lost species, as it were, the ‘Frozen Zoo’ could prove key to resurrecting previously extinct species.

Perhaps fittingly after preserving species, _The Atlantic_’s Ross Andersen examines the effort to recreate the grasslands that used to cover the Arctic and beat back the release of greenhouse gases from the melting permafrost. A major part of the strategy involves reintroducing species native to the grasslands into vast parks, ideally including woolly mammoths (or other descendants). Check it out in “[Pleistocene Park](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/pleistocene-park/517779/)”.

If you liked these longreads, or the idea of sharing thought-provoking articles you’ve come across, let me know and feel free to pass along anything interesting. Of course, feel free to share this with your friends and family as well!

Have a great weekend, Jeremy
