Hello, world! This is bad - I'm procrastinating by setting up a blog. I **_should_**
be studying MATH200. I'll split the difference and just write up this note
quickly, but not fiddle around too much with all the options/themes/etc in
Jekyll until later. So everything might look really plain for a while...

> Hi! Who are you?

~~This feels wrong, talking about myself in a public forum. I guess it's because
my name is attached to what I'm writing now.~~ My name's Jeremy, and I joke
about calling myself a recovering business student, on account of my time as a
BCom at UofT. I'm currently studying at UBC, in the BCS after-degree program.
But that's boring. I'll let the other stuff about me just kind of... organically
come about as I write?

> Jeremy, why are you writing this blog?

I've toyed with the idea of writing my thoughts out for a while - I've written
pseudo-newsletters on Medium, I've kept a couple half-used journals to document
my daily life, and I jot things down in Excel or Word all the time. Heck, I'm
pretty sure I emailed future-me an email from past-me (If this doesn't make
sense, I'll get to it eventually. I think I'm supposed to get it on my birthday).

The takeaway is this is _hopefully_ a good way to keep myself accountable and
writing, but more importantly, I hope that I'll be able to share something
valuable or useful - maybe about biz, about the BCS program (shoutout if you
want to know more about the program and you're not from UBC;
[drop me a note!](mailto:jregchiu+blog[at]gmail.com)), about food, or about
interesting notes I read online.
