**NB Dec 22, 2017:** Fun fact, I'm actually all caught up with _Stranger Things_ now (S1 and S2!) but I've fallen off the _Riverdale_ bandwagon after S1. Maybe I'll catch up over the holidays?

Good morning. Are you a Netflix subscriber? Did you catch the new Riverdale episode last night? Or maybe you went out to the _Ghost in the Shell_ release. If not, you can watch _Riverdale_ whenever you want on Netflix, and probably _Ghost in the Shell_ soon too.

I’ll admit, I’m not a subscriber myself, but I’ve fallen into the trap laid by _Stranger Things_, _Narcos_, _House of Cards_, _The Crown_, and _Riverdale_. ~~Even though I’m only caught up with Riverdale, I want to keep watching those other series too.~~ So I’m seriously considering picking up a subscription… (**NB:** yeah, I'm not up to date with _Riverdale_ anymore, so don't send me any spoilers please)

And for good reason. Netflix upped its content budget to $6 billion in 2017, up from $5 billion in 2016. To be fair, this planned spend is on both original and acquired content, so it’s not all going to Netflix Originals. But you can bet on a bunch of new series, continuing seasons, and movies for your favourite (or soon to be favourite) characters and franchises.

I’ve seen lot of mentions of Netflix becoming the first global content network. It’s pretty crazy to think of how many markets they’ve expanded into, and how they’ve gone from fighting with Blockbuster as a DVD mail-order service to an end-to-end digital distribution network and studio in their own right.

In [this _Bloomberg Businessweek_ feature](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-01-12/netflix-wants-the-world-to-binge-watch), you can learn about Netflix’s foray into Brazil, first to gain a foothold as a streaming service in the country, and later as a studio competing with the Grupo Globo media holding company. It’s an interesting look at how Netflix deals with infrastructure and consumer behaviour challenges in new markets, as well as a look into the grand experiment at producing content for local audiences and tastes that can also go global across markets.

Then, you can [learn more about the inner mechanics](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/netflixs-grand-maybe-crazy-plan-conquer-world/) of how Netflix recommends (fun fact: geography doesn’t matter much) and serves up content (geography matters here, or else they’d break the internet!) to you. _Wired_ also fills in more of the picture about Netflix’s plan for the future. By getting rid of the jigsaw licensing agreements across markets in favour of international exclusives and in-house content, Netflix’s goal is eventually to serve up the same library to everyone, everywhere, and whenever you want it. That means both series from internationally recognised tentpole franchises like Marvel, and more local (but globally popular) content like telenovelas, Korean dramas, Bollywood movies, and anime series.

Personally, I’m excited for the content created for local audiences! Maybe there’ll be more support for Canadian sci-fi (I feel like that’s something we’ve done well at for some reason?) It’ll also be interesting to see how all those dollars affect Hollywood North (here’s to hoping for more stuff produced here!)

As always, have a great weekend (maybe by watching some Netflix). And if you liked this article, please ~~hit that ❤ button and~~ share with your friends. (**NB:** clearly there's no button to hit on this blog! Maybe there will be one day)

Thanks,
Jeremy
