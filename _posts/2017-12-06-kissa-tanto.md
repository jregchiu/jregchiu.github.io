Hey y'all. So some of my amazing cousins were extremely kind and invited me to a spontaneous dinner at Kissa Tanto the other night. Was not expecting it at all - my cousin texted in the middle of the day saying she'd been trying to get a table for quite some time and had scored one for that night. And she'd just heard back about adding a third seat! It was great to catch up with my cousins after their honeymoon, and a nice break from studying for finals too.

- House bread: OMG schmaltz butter! The fresh sourdough was very homey, and the olive oil was subtly fruity
- Croquette: very smooth ... potato? ... croquette. Sauce tasted like a Japanese curry
- Octopus salad: ouuu, why is everyone doing some kind of octopus salad now? Was very tender and had a deliciously faint smokiness and nice crunch
- Lasagne: very very comforting and homey. Delicious white ragu, herby green sauce, and a faint tang from the ricotta/fior di latte? Reminded me of the lasagne in Rome :spaghetti::sparkles:
- Half chicken: yummm, this totally took me back to eating jim guk gai and/or wor siu gai as a kid!
- Japanese eggplant: I love eggplant. I love miso. Besciamella is good too. Therefore what's not to love???

Wish I could comment more on the space - seemed very cool, but I was facing out the window so I can't say much :joy: Definitely crazy packed, even on a Tuesday night - from our early sitting onwards! Don't think service was as busy after our sitting though.

Grabbed a delicious dairy-free (vegan, even?) gelato from Umaluma afterwards. Super creamy and rich - surprised it's dairy free! Was interesting that there was a faint savoriness to it as well :yum:
