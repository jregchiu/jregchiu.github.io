**NB Dec 22, 2017:** Hahaha so clearly I'm studying in a CS program now. Still not sure whether I'd call myself an engineer or a developer in the future (hey, maybe I'll skip that altogether and go work in product management...)

Jokes aside, we should definitely take our work seriously. My profs stressed the point that software interacts with the **real world**, with **very real** effects. And when mistakes happen, sadly very bad things can result.

Good morning! Thought I’d delve into programming just a little bit, as I mentioned a few weeks ago. Thanks and sorry to my friends who suggested various clickbait and listicle styled titles: I did not go with any of them.

#### [What is Code?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
Um, this is a really long longread from Paul Ford for Bloomberg. But it’s good, very very good! If you’ve ever wondering about what coding, programming, or developing entails, this is for you! Especially if you’re in a non-technical role (or don’t interact with technical folks very often).

#### [The Next Big Blue-Collar Job is Coding](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/)
I’m unsure how I feel about the view Clive Thompson expresses on coding as the next evolution of blue collar work. There’s certainly a lively debate in the comments section!

I understand how skills related to maintaining existing systems or to using a popular language and pre-existing libraries can be taught at the vocational level and can lead to stable middle-class employment. However, a lot of that work may be automated away in the near future (or may shift due to the nature of changing languages and libraries) — perhaps in this way coding is more like blue collar work than I previously thought?

On the other hand, I believe in the fundamental education that Computer Science (disclosure: I’m looking into doing a CS degree right now) provides to developers of all stripes, as it teaches the underpinnings of how and why languages and libraries work the way they do. The skills are not as immediately tailored to the job, but they allow developers to quickly pick up and understand the languages and libraries being used wherever they go, as well as to better architect new libraries and solutions to the problems they are asked to solve.

#### [Why Computer Programmers Should Stop Calling Themselves Engineers](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/)
I’m an aspiring developer (engineer? hahaha I kid) but there’s certainly something to this. This article might have been from 2014, but there is still a lot of talk about a lack of professional standards in tech (Uber Greyball, anyone?). In contrast, Professional Engineers are held to certain standards and are reminded that their work has consequences (isn’t that what the iron ring is for, Canadian engineer friends? Congrats if you just got yours!)

That being said, what’s the solution? Does it mean dropping the software engineering title, or does it mean establishing a professional standards body in line with other engineering disciplines? Does it mean something else?

Have a happy weekend y’all,
Jeremy
