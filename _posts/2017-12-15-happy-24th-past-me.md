Remember how I mentioned that I wrote to my future self? I just got the email for my birthday. I think I was inspired by a chapter in _Tools of Titans_ but I might've picked the idea up somewhere else. I wrote to myself in late June, while I was still living and working in Toronto - it seems like I had a lot of questions. I'll try and answer some of them here.

> How's it feel to be wrapping up your first term at UBC?

It feels ... good? Mostly glad to be done MATH200 and CPSC110. Still can't quite believe I'm at UBC now - like I've come full circle applying to UBC for my first degree. For some reason it doesn't feel as hectic as the first time around. I'm looking forward to sinking my teeth into a side project over the break, and then into CPSC210 and STAT302 next term.

Also I'm totally looking forward to co-op already. I miss work. Or I miss money. Probably money. And partially the work. Hey that's a good sign, right?

> What's the weather like in Vancouver? ... Is it as rainy as I think it will be? Do you enjoy staying in, cosy against the rain? Or do you hold onto those sunny days at gems?

Yes. It hasn't been quite as rainy as expected, but it's certainly grey. Apparently the fog is a new thing - it's very SF!

It's nice to stay in, but I heard some good advice about how one can't wait out the rain here, vs. in Toronto. Still working on changing that mindset. It helps that I've got a raincoat and boots. On the plus side, the weather has got me going to the gym regularly, otherwise I'd definitely have gone crazy by now.

And yes, not going to lie. I probably look like a crazy person, but I'll be cheesing like mad whenever it's sunny after a streak of grey.

> Just picked up [a new] passport, and the wanderlust is so real. I want to go to New York ... Where have we gone in the meantime?

Sadly no stamps in that passport yet. Should get on it - maybe a roadtrip down the coast, or hop a flight somewhere new if a deal pops up.

> [mentioning old friends] How are they all doing these days? Where are they at (city-wise, life-wise, work-wise)?

They're doing well! Lots of friends are still in Toronto, but some are spread out more broadly. Obviously a lot of HS friends are still in Alberta. I guess it's a toss up on the life/work/school axis too - some friends are getting married, some are raising kids, others are in various stages of grad school/looking at grad school, and plenty are working.

I'm looking forward to catching up with plenty of friends over the break. Will be nice to see in person how they're doing.

> How are classes and work? Am I right to be worried about the workload compared to Rotman? ... What key takeaway from a class has stood out to you? What do you wish you could tell me?

Oh hey. I didn't realise I'd been worried about the workload! Hahaha yes it's definitely different. Short turnaround times, more deliverables, and labs everywhere are annoying. I added up my class meet times, and I'm pretty sure 3 classes are taking up more time than when I took 5 or 6 classes!

Hmm, I thought it was neat that we got to see, at a very high level, how a computer performs operations in CPSC121. It's neat, to peel back the curtain on the magic, even if it's just a very cursory glance at the moment vs. upper year courses.

I'm not sure I have anything that I really wish I could tell me to prepare for the past. Or is it the future?
